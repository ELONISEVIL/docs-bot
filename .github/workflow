```python
# Import the necessary library
import re

# Create a list of documents to be searched
documents = [
    "This is the first document. It talks about technology.",
    "The second document discusses artificial intelligence and machine learning.",
    "Document three focuses on data science and analytics."
]

# Function to perform the search
def search_documents(query, documents):
    results = []
    for i, doc in enumerate(documents):
        if re.search(query, doc, re.IGNORECASE):
            results.append(i)
    return results

# Example usage
query = input("Enter your search query: ")
print("Search Results:", search_documents(query, documents))
```

This is a basic example in Python that searches through a list of documents using regular expressions. You can modify and expand upon this code to create a more advanced and comprehensive search engine.
